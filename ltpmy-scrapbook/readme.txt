WP VeriteCo Timeline integrates VeriteCo's Timeline JS into the WordPress back-end.

== Description ==
WPVT integrates the wonderful JS plugin created by [VeriteCo](http://timeline.verite.co/ "Timeline JS") seamlessly into your WordPress back-end. It allows you to manage timeline entries through a Timeline custom post type. WPVT automatically generates the JSON data file from your database and styles it according to your settings.
